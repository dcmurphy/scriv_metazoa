\f0\fs28 \cf0 We\'92ve seen substantial progress over the last couple of decades. The embrace of cladistics and increasingly sophisticated techniques in molecular and computational phylogenetics have confirmed some metazoan relationships gleaned from the study of morphology and embryology, upended others, and provided insights which have led to new perspectives and avenues of inquiry. \
However, the base of the animal tree of life, the logical place to start in any examination of animal diversity, is in a serious muddle. Smart people strongly disagree on fundamental relationships. This, in turn, affects how we view the rest of the tree and formulate questions about what it is to be an animal.  }
