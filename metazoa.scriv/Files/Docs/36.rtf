\f0\fs28 \cf0 We\'92ve seen substantial progress over the last couple of decades. The embrace of cladistics and increasingly sophisticated techniques in molecular and computational biology has confirmed some metazoan relationships gleaned from the study of morphology and embryology, upended others, and provided insights which have led to new perspectives and avenues of inquiry. \
Alas, the base of the animal tree of life, the logical place to start, is in a muddle. Smart people strongly disagree on the fundamentals, on the first branches. This, in turn, affects how we look at the rest of the tree. Things are unsettled. These are interesting times.\
For the sake of discussion, we\'92ll name five basal groups: sponges, ctenophores, cnidarians, placozoans and bilaterians.}
