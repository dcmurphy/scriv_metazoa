\f0\fs28 \cf0 One of the problem with using species richness (the number of species within a phylum or any other group) that we may not be discerning species accurately. Animals with distinctive and durable structures lend themselves more readily to identification than those with soft bodies and nondescript forms. It\'92s generally easier for us tell one type of fish from another than it is to distinguish between two species of worms. We may not be able to tell these worms apart, but they have no problem finding each other and making babies.\
Species richness can be misleading in an arguably more fundamental way. Nature is replete with examples where a group represented by just a few species\'97or even a single species\'97dominates an ecosystem. For instance, there are only about 100 species of salps, but these drifting gelatinous animals play an out-sized role in food webs and carbon cycles, especially in the oceans surrounding Antartica. Similarly, there are only a couple dozen species of large mammalian herbivores in Africa but they play a critical role in creating and maintaining the continent\'92s iconic savannas.}
