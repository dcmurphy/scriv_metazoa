\f0\fs28 \cf0 The number of species is one measure of a phylum\'92s evolutionary \'93success.\'94 It\'92s an imperfect measure, in part because animals with distinctive and durable structures lend themselves more readily to identification than those with soft bodies and nondescript forms; it\'92s generally easier to tell one type of fish from another than it is to distinguish between two species of worms. Species richness can be misleading in other ways. For instance, a species of lizard may be restricted to the upper elevations of a mountain in a South Pacific island whereas the migratory locust can form huge swarms covering vast areas of Africa. Nonetheless, a stronger case for evolutionary success can usually be made for a group containing 5,000 species than one containing only a hundred. \
